<span style='font-size:18px; color:#01937C'><strong>Module Listing</strong></span><br/><br/>
<span style='font-size:15px;'><strong>Force and motion</strong></span> <br/><br/>
In every measurement that you make you need to measure in standard units. Over the millennia of measurement humanity has made use of a variety of means of measurement..<br/><br/>
<span style='font-size:15px;'><strong>Electricity</strong> </span> <br/><br/>
Units in electricity are a little more mysterious than those studied in force and motion, often people get confused and are not really sure what goes with what..<br/><br/>
<span style='font-size:15px;'><strong>Waves</strong> </span><br/><br/>
When you have worked through this section, you will be able to use the following units: degree (°), hertz (Hz), meter (m), metre/second (m/s) and second (s).
<br/><br/>
<span style='font-size:15px;'><strong>Energy resources and energy transfer</strong> </span><br/><br/>
This module covers kilogram (kg), joule (J), metre  (m), metre/second (m/s), meter/second2 (m/s2), newton (N), second (s) and watt (W)
<br/><br/>
<span style='font-size:15px;'><strong>Solids, liquids and gases</strong> </span><br/><br/>
In working with the three states of matter, we find that there are a number of units that are very particular to this area of physics.
<br/><br/>
<span style='font-size:15px;'><strong>Magnetism and electromagnetism</strong> </span><br/><br/>
This modules covers the following units: ampere (A), volt (V) and watt (W).
<br/><br/>
<span style='font-size:15px;'><strong>Radioactivity and particles</strong> </span><br/><br/>
We have  all heard about radioactivity. It always has a very scary aspect to it. But just what is radioactivity?
<br/><br/>
<span style='font-size:15px;'><strong>Astrophysics</strong> </span><br/><br/>
The physics of forces and motion can also be applied to the bigger, and more unknown area of space. We can understand the motion of planets and why we have solar systems, galaxies and the other contents of the universe. In this section we will look at the importance of gravity in space and some calculations of speeds in space.

<span style='font-size:18px; color:#01937C'><strong>How do I sit the IGCSE Exam?</strong></span><br/><br/> Approximately 6 months before an exam date, Students should book their place at an exam centre to take the Pearson Edexcel International IGCSE Physics (specification 4PH1) exam.

The exam centre could be a private exam centre or a school or college that is also submitting its own students for the exam.

Edexcel publish a list of exam centres that accept private candidates. This won’t cover every available centre, so if there’s nothing shown in your area, we recommend contacting local schools and colleges directly.

Exam fees are not included in the course cost as they are paid directly to the exam centre. They will vary depending on which centre you choose.
<br/><br/>

<span style='font-size:18px; color:#01937C'><strong>Career path</strong></span><br/><br/> Upon completing this course, students will now have the foundations and fundamental knowledge needed to develop their Business skills further. This could be through enrolling in another one of our business-related courses, such as Level 4&5 Business and Management. Job roles associated with Business include: Managers, Marketers, Sales team member, Sales analyst, and Product management.
<br/><br/>

<span style='font-size:18px; color:#01937C'><strong>How will I know if I am eligible to complete an IGCSE?</strong></span><br/><br/> The typical age at which people choose to complete the IGCES’s is 14 to 16, but anyone over the age of 14 can enrol onto this course. You also do not need any previous qualifications to be eligible for this course."

The Physics IGCSE is an internationally recognised qualification designed to develop a solid understanding of physics formulae, ideas, and studies within different circumstances, such as different types of motion. The course is mapped against Pearsons Edexcel international IGCSE Physics. This IGCSE qualification is the same as you would study in school.
<br/><br/>
In this course, students will study the practical nature of physics as well as the theoretical, learning to form hypotheses and design experiments. In terms of scientific knowledge, they will learn to evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of scientific and technological developments.
<br/><br/>
Students will also become familiar with, be able to utilise correctly, essential scientific formula, and identify the different symbols used within these formulae.
<br/><br/>
The content of this course is covered in 8 modules. It includes an assessment upon completion to help test and cement the student’s knowledge and understanding. Therefore, this gives our students the best chance of an IGCSE qualification in a flexible and affordable manner.
