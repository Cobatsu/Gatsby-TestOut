<span style='font-size:15px;'><strong>Force and motion</strong></span> <br/><br/>
In every measurement that you make you need to measure in standard units. Over the millennia of measurement humanity has made use of a variety of means of measurement..<br/><br/>
<span style='font-size:15px;'><strong>Electricity</strong> </span> <br/><br/>
Units in electricity are a little more mysterious than those studied in force and motion, often people get confused and are not really sure what goes with what..<br/><br/>
<span style='font-size:15px;'><strong>Waves</strong> </span><br/><br/>
When you have worked through this section, you will be able to use the following units: degree (°), hertz (Hz), meter (m), metre/second (m/s) and second (s).
<br/><br/>
<span style='font-size:15px;'><strong>Energy resources and energy transfer</strong> </span><br/><br/>
This module covers kilogram (kg), joule (J), metre  (m), metre/second (m/s), meter/second2 (m/s2), newton (N), second (s) and watt (W)
<br/><br/>
<span style='font-size:15px;'><strong>Solids, liquids and gases</strong> </span><br/><br/>
In working with the three states of matter, we find that there are a number of units that are very particular to this area of physics.
<br/><br/>
<span style='font-size:15px;'><strong>Magnetism and electromagnetism</strong> </span><br/><br/>
This modules covers the following units: ampere (A), volt (V) and watt (W).
<br/><br/>
<span style='font-size:15px;'><strong>Radioactivity and particles</strong> </span><br/><br/>
We have  all heard about radioactivity. It always has a very scary aspect to it. But just what is radioactivity?
<br/><br/>
<span style='font-size:15px;'><strong>Astrophysics</strong> </span><br/><br/>
The physics of forces and motion can also be applied to the bigger, and more unknown area of space. We can understand the motion of planets and why we have solar systems, galaxies and the other contents of the universe. In this section we will look at the importance of gravity in space and some calculations of speeds in space.

The Physics IGCSE is an internationally recognised qualification designed to develop a solid understanding of physics formulae, ideas, and studies within different circumstances, such as different types of motion. The course is mapped against Pearsons Edexcel international IGCSE Physics. This IGCSE qualification is the same as you would study in school.
<br/><br/>
In this course, students will study the practical nature of physics as well as the theoretical, learning to form hypotheses and design experiments. In terms of scientific knowledge, they will learn to evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of scientific and technological developments.
<br/><br/>
Students will also become familiar with, be able to utilise correctly, essential scientific formula, and identify the different symbols used within these formulae.
<br/><br/>
The content of this course is covered in 8 modules. It includes an assessment upon completion to help test and cement the student’s knowledge and understanding. Therefore, this gives our students the best chance of an IGCSE qualification in a flexible and affordable manner.
