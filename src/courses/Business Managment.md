curriculum_1: " <span ><strong>Managing business operations</strong></span> <br/><br/> Effective management of the business operations undertaken within an organisation is the key to its overall success. No organisation will be able to achieve its objectives without effective management of its operations. This module is divided into six sections, each of which deals with one aspect of the management of business operations.<br/><br/>
<span ><strong>Maximising resources</strong> </span> <br/><br/>
An organisation that fails to dedicate sufficient attention to its use of resources will prove to be unprofitable over time. By being observant and prudent, any organisation can achieve significant gains from the management of its resources.<br/><br/>
<span ><strong>The business environment</strong> </span><br/><br/>
A sound understanding of the environment in which an organisation operates is a valuable asset in management. In order to make effective decisions, it is important for managers to be aware of the factors that influence the environment and the benefits which can be achieved from using the nature of the environment to good effect. Without such knowledge, it is easy to misjudge the consequence of any actions taken.
<br/><br/>
<span ><strong>Managing people in organisations</strong> </span><br/><br/>
Effective management of people within an organisation is essential if the objectives of the organisation are to be achieved. People represent the single most important resource of the organisation and their needs must be understood and respected.
<br/><br/>
<span ><strong>Working in teams</strong> </span><br/><br/>
Modern organisations use opportunities for team working as much as possible as this is an effective and proven method for getting the best performance from members of the workforce. Teams may be involved in all activities of an organisation – from production right through to financial decision making. This module looks at the role played by teams within organisations and how the human element interacts.
<br/><br/>
<span ><strong>Effective business communication</strong> </span><br/><br/>
Good communication is essential in any organisation in order to pass information from one person to another. This module explains the need for effective communication and demonstrates how this can be achieved within a work environment.
