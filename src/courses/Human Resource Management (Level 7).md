Do you want to be an effective human resource manager and leader? The Level 7 Human Resource Management course is a 120 credits course designed to meet the needs of senior/middle managers in the running of their businesses, and to facilitate their progression to high levels within their organisation. Managers need to be aware of issues, able to analyse their potential outcomes and consequences, and decide how to react. They do not have to be expert in all areas of business, but they need to possess a general awareness of what specialist facilities and services exist, and how they can assist in carrying out that role. This course is made up of 6 modules and gives learners the ability to progress onto the final year of a postgraduate degree.
