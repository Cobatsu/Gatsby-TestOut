The exam centre could be a private exam centre or a school or college that is also submitting its own students for the exam.

Edexcel publish a list of exam centres that accept private candidates. This won’t cover every available centre, so if there’s nothing shown in your area, we recommend contacting local schools and colleges directly.

Exam fees are not included in the course cost as they are paid directly to the exam centre. They will vary depending on which centre you choose.
