The route to teaching in the state school sector using this level 5 qualification is through membership of the Society of Education & Training (SET).
<br/><br/>
To be eligible for SET membership students are required to have completed their Initial Teacher Training (ITT). ITT involves successful completion of a Level 5 Teacher Training Course, assuming candidates have already completed a Level 2 (GCSE) Maths and English or equivalent. Completion of the courses provides students with their Qualified Teacher Learning Skills (QTLS) which is equivalent to the Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) and sufficient to teach in state schools, as well as Further Education.
<br/><br/>
For more information on the QTLS and how to achieve it on completion of this level 5 Education and Training qualification, please click here

Students may wish to contact SET direct for further clarification of their requirements.

The Level 5 Diploma in Education and Training is suitable for individuals who are already practising within the education sector or those who are not currently practising but have a significant amount of experience and now wish to consolidate that with a formal qualification. The course is a 120-credit qualification and is accredited by the Ofqual recognised organisation, Qualifi.
<br/><br/>
Throughout this course, students will gain the experience and knowledge required to meet the necessary criteria through a combination of theoretical study and practical activity. The theory content will be delivered through our 9 online modules. The practical activity is to be carried out during a placement in a real-world teaching position. This can be either a position the student already occupies at the start of the course or a position that they find over the course of their study with Richmond College, and can be located at a school, college or community group – the only restriction is that there must be a mentor at the placement who is able to support and verify the students work.
<br/><br/>
This programme will be assessed via a combination of 9 online multiple-choice assessments and 7 written assignments. These written assignments will be comprised of multiple tasks, each made up of a Part A and a Part B. Part A will be based on the online academic content, whilst Part B will be based on the student’s own personal experience on their teaching placement. Parts A and B can also be completed separately, meaning that students will not need a teaching placement to begin working on their written assignments. However, they will need a placement to complete them.
<br/><br/>
This course prepares students to teach in a wide range of contexts. Upon successfully completing this course, students will be able to plan and implement schemes of work, develop teaching and learning strategies, and teach effectively in public and private schools, colleges and universities in many countries all over the world.
<br/><br/>
On completion of this course and once students have gained their QTLS, Richmond College has partnered with T15 International to help students find their perfect job within the teaching sector.
