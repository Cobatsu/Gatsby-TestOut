The Business IGCSE is an internationally recognised qualification that is designed to develop a good understanding of business terminology, concepts, and ideas within different contexts, such as international markets.

  -The aims of this course are to provide students with an in depth understanding of business ideas, skills, and concepts, through familiarising our students with business terminology and examples of real-life scenarios which are embedded throughout the course.

  -The course provides students with a solid understanding of key business concepts, which includes: stakeholders, finance, roles within a business, production, international markets, types of businesses, expansion and innovation.

This content is covered over 5 modules, all of which contain an assessment upon completion to help test and cement the studentâ€™s knowledge and understanding. Therefore, this gives our students the best chance of an IGCSE qualification in a flexible and affordable manner.
