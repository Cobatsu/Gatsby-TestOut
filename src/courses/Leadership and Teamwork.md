curriculum_1: " <span style='font-size:15px;'><strong>Managing people in organisations
</strong></span> <br/><br/>
Effective management of people within an organisation is essential if the objectives of the organisation are to be achieved. People represent the single most important resource of the organisation and their needs must be understood and respected.<br/><br/>
<span style='font-size:15px;'><strong>Culture and the organisation</strong> </span> <br/><br/>
What is culture? What do you associate with culture? Perhaps art and music, perhaps values and beliefs, language and communication, behaviour – in fact, culture is a collection of all of these things. Terpstra and David (1991) define culture as ‘a learned, shared, interrelated set of symbols which unite and identify members of a society’.<br/><br/>
<span style='font-size:15px;'><strong>Developing personal skills</strong> </span><br/><br/>
The manager working in a modern organisation needs a wide range of skills. The manager needs to be able to work with people. This may involve a very wide range of skills in communication, leadership, encouraging teamwork, listening, and so on.
<br/><br/>
<span style='font-size:15px;'><strong>Effective communication</strong> </span><br/><br/>
During a typical day a manager is likely to encourage team members, tell them about a change in their future work or conditions, take part in a formal meeting, have an informal conversation at the water cooler or coffee machine, study a strategy planned by senior management, send e-mails to customers or suppliers, and search the Web.
<br/><br/>
<span style='font-size:15px;'><strong>Systems analysis and design</strong> </span><br/><br/>
This module provides an understanding of IS concepts and how they relate to organisation needs in respect of business processes and transformation of information.
<br/><br/>
<span style='font-size:15px;'><strong>Managing ethically</strong> </span><br/><br/>
Unfortunately, it is not always easy to decide on what we mean by ‘the right action’. For example, think of the company that produces excessive amounts of waste in its factory. Closing the factory will harm the employees and shareholders, and will reduce the amount of money available in the local community. Keeping it open without reducing waste will damage the environment for local people and for future generations.
<br/><br/>
<span style='font-size:15px;'><strong>Performance management</strong> </span><br/><br/>
The people in an organisation determine whether the organisation is successful or not. Think for a moment about any organisation – in doing this you will also be thinking about people. Every organisation has people within it, and the success of the organisation is largely due to those people.
<br/><br/>
<span style='font-size:15px;'><strong>Strategic human resource management</strong> </span><br/><br/>
Human Resource Management is the management of a key resource in the organisation – people. Without people there is a limit to what the organisation can achieve. The machines cannot operate without people to work them (even if they are automatic machines there needs to be a person who programmes them). The raw materials need to be turned into something that can be sold: this requires people. The computers need people to operate them.
<br/><br/>
<span style='font-size:15px;'><strong>High performance teams</strong> </span><br/><br/>
In a world of change, uncertainty and complexity, high performance in an organisation requires a blend of diverse skills and experiences. Organisations recognise that this blend is best achieved through team working.
<br/><br/>
<span style='font-size:15px;'><strong>Leadership skills</strong> </span><br/><br/>
Good leadership is essential for success in any organisation, whether private or public sector.  Today, rapid change, in the form of a constantly changing competitive environment, innovations in technology and changing economic conditions, have led to the realisation that leadership is a skill to be developed. 
<br/><br/>
<span style='font-size:15px;'><strong>Motivating and influencing people</strong> </span><br/><br/>
Think about two teams carrying out the same activity. Their manager may ask how a series of tasks will be completed to create a product or service. The manager can plan how the work will be done, make sure that the teams have all the right materials, explain everyone’s tasks and deadlines, and measure progress once they get started. However, the two teams will almost certainly not work at the same speed, not create output of the same quality, nor show the same attitude to their work.<br/><br/>"
curriculum_2: " <span style='font-size:15px;'><strong>The entrepreneurial manager</strong></span> <br/><br/>
What is an Entrepreneur? Examine the skills and qualities of entrepreneurship.<br/><br/>
<span style='font-size:15px;'><strong>Organisation structures</strong> </span> <br/><br/>
Why are organisations structured in the way they are? What determines the optimum structure and how does it differ between organisations? In this module, learners will look at the numerous models and theories that make up organisational structure.<br/><br/>
<span style='font-size:15px;'><strong>Practical accounting analysis</strong> </span><br/><br/>
Learners will complete exercises in accounts throughout this module to understand what they are telling us and the actions that analysis can precipitate.
<br/><br/>
<span style='font-size:15px;'><strong>Business planning and goal setting</strong> </span><br/><br/>
What is the business trying to achieve? What will it do? How will it do it? This module focuses on the creation of clear goals and clear plans to achieve a clear objective.
<br/><br/>
<span style='font-size:15px;'><strong>Politics and business</strong> </span><br/><br/>
Impact of politics on business and how it may help or hinder business. This module will educate learners on economic impact, exports and government support.
<br/><br/>
<span style='font-size:15px;'><strong>Business law</strong> </span><br/><br/>
Explore the statutory responsibilities of managers as learners look into the legalities of business and business executives.
<br/><br/>
<span style='font-size:15px;'><strong>Managing in today’s world</strong> </span><br/><br/>
Business in the modern world. This module focuses on governance and equality as a means to do right in business.
<br/><br/>
<span style='font-size:15px;'><strong>Performance management</strong> </span><br/><br/>
Understanding how your people and your business can continually improve together, learners will review reward structures, CPD, training and development to ensure high performance in business.
<br/><br/>
<span style='font-size:15px;'><strong>Marketing and sales planning</strong> </span><br/><br/>
Learners will analyse how markets, customers, competitors and products can come together in a cohesive plan.
<br/><br/>
<span style='font-size:15px;'><strong>Quantitative skills</strong> </span><br/><br/>
On successful completion of this module, learners will have knowledge of numeric exercises and will understand their use within the context of the business."

The Undergraduate Level 4 (Leadership and Teamwork) and Level 5 (Extended Diploma in Management) are a 240 credit course designed to fast track students to the final year of an associated Undergraduate degree in Leadership and management, which can either be completed at a UK university on campus or via distance learning.
<br/><br/>
The Level 4 modules and assignments of this course are equivalent to the first year of a University Degree and the Level 5 modules and assignments are equivalent to the second year of a University Degree.
<br/><br/>
This course is made up of 10 Level 4 modules (120 credits) and 10 Level 5 modules (120 credits); each level also includes 10 written assignments. If a student decides to only study at Level 4, they will receive 120 credits and can apply for an exemption from the first year of a university Degree course.
<br/><br/>
Each module consists of approximately 40 guided learning hours of material with an additional 30-50 hours of optional learning material. These materials comprise recommended exercises, recommended readings and internet resources.
